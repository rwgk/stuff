~c rwgk
~s error
When working on the other sequences I found out that the one from
yesterday has the wrong explanation. The correct one would be:

Number of 3x3 integer matrices with elements in the range [-N,N],
determinant +1 or -1, and trace in the range [-3,3].

I do not believe this is very interesting and I think it would be best
not to replace the explanation but the sequence itself. Please do not
add my previously submitted sequence to your database.

My error is actually due to two mistakes which are very convoluted to
explain. No excuse. I am really sorry and very embarrassed.

My error is partially due to the fact that I misused a bigger program
to do the computation. To make sure that I get it right this time
around, I stripped down the code to force myself to know exactly what
subroutines I am using and what they are doing. I also put in a few
extra checks. 

The results up to seven terms are appended. I will use the web form
once I have ten terms and I have reassured myself that all the numbers
are correct and consistent. It will take about a day of CPU time to
compute the ten terms.

Number of 3x3 integer matrices with elements in the range [-N,N] which
generate a group of finite order under binary matrix multiplication.
A0 = 1584, 13056, 57744, 133440, 307632, 519888, 990288

Number of 3x3 integer matrices with elements in the range [-N,N] which
represent a two-fold rotation. Also the sequence for the corresponding
two-fold rotoinversions.
